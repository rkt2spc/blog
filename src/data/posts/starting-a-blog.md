# Motivation

It's 2023, shortly after becoming a father, I suddenly realized that I was getting old and decided to start this blog hoping to leave traces of my somewhat short human existence in this world.

# To Build Or Not To Build

Before starting this, I asked myself: why don't I just use [Medium] or [Substack]? Why build my own blog?

The answer is I want to make this blog personal, my own sanctum, my home on the internet. I want to be able to customize it however I want, to the smallest details. It should give an experience that is uniquely mine.

# The Tech

After decided on building my blog, I need to choose a technology to build it with. There exist many technology choices for building a blog nowadays, from static site generators like [Jekyll] or [Hugo], to writing it from scratch using a front-end library like [React].

I happen to be familiar with React. Thanks to frameworks like [NextJs] or [Gatsby], React development is now much more pleasant than what it used to be. You no longer have to worry about configuring bundlers like [Webpack], or how to do client side routing properly. I ended up picking NextJs as I've heard many wonderful things about it.

# The Learning

NextJs is not too difficult to learn if you're already familiar with React. It literally took me half a day to get the first version of my blog up and running. Maybe that's how NextJs was designed, to make you feel ultra productive.

Now my blog is running. But oh boy, it is ugly! How can website look good without some CSS styling eh?

Initially, I went for
