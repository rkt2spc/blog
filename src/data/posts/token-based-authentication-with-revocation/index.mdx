summary: A method of implementing revocable token based authentication

# Authentication and Authorization

**Authentication**: the process by which we confirm that a party is who
they says they are, we often refer to that party as the principal

**Authorization**: the mechanism by which we confine a principal to
the actions that we allow them to do

# Authentication Approaches

## Stateful Authentication

When a principal logs in to our system we create an entry on a stateful
storage (we call this the session store) and give the session entry ID
back to the entity for subsequent interactions.

Session ID must be generated in a way that it is unique and
cryptographically safe.

Note: Only the cryptographic hashes of the passwords are stored, not their raw form.

## Stateless Authentication

When a principal logs in to our system, we create a proof-of-login token that will be returned to the principal for subsequent interactions. And, for it to be called stateless, we **DO NOT** store it anywhere within our system.

To achieve this, the login token must be:

- Universally unique
- Cryptographically signed to ensure integrity with optional encryption on top

## Cryptographic Signing

**Requirement**: The content of a token **MUST NOT** be modified by anyone else after creation.

- This is done by attaching a digital signature along with the token payload. The signature is created by cryptographically hashing the payload and a secret.
- Every time a token is received, the payload will be hashed again with the secret to generate an authentic signature, this signature will then be compare to the attached signature in the token.
- Due to the nature of cryptographic hash. Third-parties cannot generate an authentic signature without knowing the secret. If the content was modified the hash result will change. Thus failing signature validation.

Example: [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io)

Generate: JWT = **header.payload.<span className="text-sky-500">signature</span>**  
Where **<span className="text-sky-500">signature</span>** = Hash(base64(**header**).base64(**payload**), **<span className="text-green-500">secret</span>**))

Validate: JWT = **header.payload.<span className="text-red-600">signature</span>**  
Check if **<span className="text-red-600">signature</span>** == Hash(base64(**header**).base64(**payload**), **<span className="text-green-500">secret</span>**))

## Encrypting

**Requirement**: The content of a token MUST NOT be readable by anyone else other than the issuer.

- This is done by encrypting the token with a secret. Should be done with a secure cipher.

Example: [JSON Web Encryption](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516)

# Truly Stateless?

## Revocation

**Requirements**:

- Log out of the current session
- Log out of all sessions
- Log out specific sessions

## Revocation in Stateful Authentication

Simply delete all corresponding session entries in the session store

## Revocation in Stateless Authentication

How can we revoke tokens that we do not store?

# Advanced Token Based Authentication

## Access Token & Refresh Token

To solve revocation, tokens are effectively categorized into 2 types: **Access Token** & [**Refresh Token**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.5))

**Access Token** is used for accessing protected resources. It should have a short to medium expire time.

**Refresh Token** is used for acquiring new **Access Tokens** and MUST be stateful. If **Refresh Token** is stateless we will come back to the exact limitations encountered before (n + 1 problem). It should have a very long or forever expire time.

Logging out the current session, all sessions, specific sessions are now just a simple delete of the corresponding **Refresh Tokens** in our database.

![Access Tokens & Refresh Tokens](./access-tokens-refresh-tokens.webp)

How is using **Refresh Tokens** differs from using a stateful session store?

- Database retrieval for **Refresh Tokens** only happen once you require a new **Access Token** which is the interval of your **Access Token** expire time. Total database hit is much less than querying for login entries in the session store that happens every API call.
- Refresh Tokens(s) travel through the internet in much less frequency than the traditional session ID. So in a sense, it is more secure.

## Unexpired Access Token(s)

In previous sections, we assumed that, using the **Access Token & Refresh Token** strategy, logging out current session, all sessions, specific sessions are now just a simple delete of the corresponding **Refresh Tokens** in our database.

What will happen to the unexpired **Access Token(s)** after the deletion of corresponding **Refresh Tokens**?  
They are still usable for accessing protected resources during their time-to-live

## Blocking Revoked Access Tokens

In order to invalidate unexpired **Access Token(s)**, we generate a block-list entry when a **Refresh Token** is revoked.

Since every **Access Token** is generated by a source **Refresh Token**. We can simply embed the **Refresh Token ID** to the **Access Token**

When we verify an access token, we can extract the source **Refresh Token ID** and make sure that it doesn't exist the the block list.

=> What we are doing here is essentially having a session store for logout sessions

How does the logout session store differ with traditional login session store?

- It is much smaller. Users tend to stay logged in for a longer amount of time.
- Each recorded logout session entry only need to exist for the time-to-live of generated Access Token(s) and can be cleaned up to reduce collection size.
